RD Test - UX Designer

In this test the porpouse is to create a case study page for RD Station clients. 

Target: New clients.

What I've tried to do is the following:

* Create a structure of reading with imagens and texts, in order to illustrate and keep the user on the page;
* Put the quotes of the client in the middle of these texts, because it's easy to understand and put value on the product;
* Keep the identity of the actual website, with colors and fonts;
* As the page has a lot of texts, it was necessary to use white spaces and different aligments, this way it was easy to scan the page and help the user readability;  
* Finish the page with a call to action for the product, the main objective of the page.
