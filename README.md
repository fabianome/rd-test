RD Test - UX Designer

In this test the purpose was to create a case study page for RD Station clients. 

Target: New clients.

What I've tried reach:

* Create a structure of reading with images and texts, in order to illustrate and keep the user on the page;
* Put the quotes of the client in the middle of these texts, because it's easy to understand and put value on the product;
* Keep the identity of the actual website, with colors and fonts;
* As the page has a lot of texts, it was necessary to use white spaces and different alignments, this way it was easy to scan the page and help the user readability;  
* Finish the page with a call to action for the product, the main objective of the page.

Plus: 

To start any project I like to use a quick way to make wireframes and test the design. In this case the wireframes was enough with paper and pencil, then I jump to Sketch to make the design and organize the informations.

There is a folder called "Assets", illustrating this process with two images:

* Wireframe, did with paper and pencil;
* Layout, made on Sketch app.
